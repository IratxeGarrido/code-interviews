# You've built an inflight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.

# Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first
# one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can
# see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose
# total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

# Write a method that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and an array
# of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating
# whether there are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum equals flight_length.

# When building your method:

# Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
# Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
# Optimize for runtime over memory

def can_two_movies_fill_flight?(movie_lengths, flight_length)
  # Determine if two movie runtimes add up to the flight length.

  if movie_lengths.length == 2
    return movie_lengths[0] + movie_lengths[1] == flight_length

  elsif movie_lengths.length < 2
    return false

  else

    movie_lengths.each_with_index do |movie, index|
      movie_lengths.each_with_index do |movie2, index2|
        next if index == index2
        return true if movie + movie2 == flight_length
      end
    end
